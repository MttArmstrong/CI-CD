We have CI setup to perform our automated checks.

We have continued to add new features and now, we want to get these new features to our Users.

Just as we have automated code checks, we can automated deployment of our package to a package registry upon a release trigger.

# Setup CD for Releases

We previously created our CI workflow YAML file.

We _could_ keep using that one, possibly.

However, we previously were triggering on every single `push` event
(i.e. anytime we uploaded any commits to any branch!)

## Trigger for CD

Do we want to publish our Python Package for any pushed code? Definitely not!

We want to instead pick the trigger event
and create a new GitHub Actions YAML just for our CD workflow.

There are different triggers we can use:
* any tags pushed to the repository
~~~
on:
    push:
      tags:
        - '*'
~~~
{: .language-yaml }

* tags that match semantic version formatting (below is a [regular expression](https://regexlearn.com/learn/regex101) used to match a pattern of text)
~~~
on:
    push:
      tags: 'v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-*'
~~~
{: .language-yaml }

* manually triggered from UI and / or on GitHub Releases
~~~
on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    release:
      types:
        - published
~~~
{: .language-yaml }

Let's continue using the "releases" one.

The first, [`workflow_dispatch`][workflow-dispatch], allows you to manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub web UI for testing.

The second, [`release`][release-action], will trigger whenever you make a [GitHub Release][release-github].

Now that we have our triggers, we need to do something with them.

We want to push our Python Package to a package registry.

But first, we must build our distrbution to upload!

## Build job for CD

Let's start on our new CD YAML for releases.

Write the following in `.github/workflows/releases.yaml`
~~~
name: Releases

on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    release:
      types:
        - published

jobs:
  dist:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Build SDist & wheel
      run: pipx run build

    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build-artifact
        path: dist/*
~~~
{: .language-yaml }

Here we have a job called "dist" that:
* Checks out the repository using the `actions/checkout` Action again.
* Uses [pipx][pipx] to run the build of the source (SDist) and build (wheels) distrubtions. This produces the wheel and sdist in `./dist` directory.
* Use a new Action, called `actions/upload-artifact` ([Markplace page](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact))

From the `actions/upload-artifact` [Markplace page](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact), we can see this saves artifacts between jobs by uploading and storing them in GitHub.

Specifically, we are uploading and storing the artifacts from the `./dist` directory in the previous step and naming that artiface "build-artifact". We will see, this is how we can pass the artifacts to another job or download ourselves from the GitHub UI.

This gives us our first step in the CD process, building the artifacts for a software release!

## Test using build artifacts in another job

Now, we want to take the artifact in the `dist` job and use it in our next phase.

To do so, we need to use the complimentary Action to `actions/upload-artifact, which is `action/download-artifact`.

From the [Marketplace page](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/download-a-build-artifact), we can see this simply downloads the artifact that is stored using the `path`.

Let's add a "test" `publish` job.

~~~
name: Releases

on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    release:
      types:
        - published

jobs:
  dist:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build SDist & wheel
        run: pipx run build

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: "build-artifact"
          path: dist/*

  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact
        with:
          name: "build-artifact"
          path: dist

      - name: Publish release
        run: echo "Uploading!"
~~~
{: .language-yaml }

Using the above test YAML, let's upload this and perform a release to run the CD pipeline.

First, checkout a new branch for CD from `main`.

```bash
git checkout -b add-cd
git add .github/workflows/releases.yml
git commit -m "Adds build + test publish to CD"
git push -u origin add-cd
```

Go ahead and merge this in `main` as well.

Then, let's go into the Actions tab and run the Release job from the UI:

![Release manual]({{ page.root }}/fig/python-cd-run-workflow.png)

![pipeline]({{ path.root }}/fig/python-cd-pipeline-pass.png)

{: .challenge }

DEBUG
![pipeline]({{ path.root }}/fig/python-cd-pipeline-pass.png)

We previously asked about jobs running in sequence or parallel.

By default, jobs run in parallel.

Yet, here, we clearly need to operate in sequence since the build must occur before the publish.

To define this dependency, we need the [`needs`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds) command.

From the documentation, `needs` takes either a previous job name or a list of previous job names that are required before this one runs:
~~~
jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    needs: [job1, job2]
~~~
{: .language-yaml }

Let's add a "test" `publish` job.

> ## Action: Test out the publish YAML - Take 2!
>
> Re-write the current YAML using `needs` to fix the dependency issue.
> Mainly, we need to specify that the `publish` job `needs` the `dist` job to run first.

Let's add these changes and push!

```bash
git add .github/workflows/releases.yml
git commit -m "Fixes build + test publish to CD"
git push
```

Perform another manual run for the Releases workflow and check the results!

![pipeline]({{ path.root }}/fig/python-cd-pipeline-pass.png)

We have a successfful pipeline with the proper dependencies and the artifacts!

We are ready to swap out the test publishing step with a more realistic example.

## Publish to Test PyPi package repository

Instead of creating a "production" version in [PyPi](https://pypi.org/),
we can use [Test PyPi](https://test.pypi.org/) instead.

### Get API token from TestPyPi -> GitHub Actions

> ## Notice: The following requires createing an account on TestPyPi, putting secrets in the GitHub repository, and uploading a Python package to TestPyPi.
> 
> If you do not feel comfortable with these tasks, feel free to just read along
{: .callout }

To setup using TestPyPi, we need to:
* [Register](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/) for an account on TestPyPi

![Register page]({{ path.root }}/fig/testpypi-register.png)

* Get an [API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken) so we can have GitHub authenticate to TestPyPi on our behalf. Go to the TestPyPi and [get an API token](https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens)

![Token page]({{ path.root }}/fig/testpypi-api-token.png)

* Go to `Settings` -> `Secrets` -> `Actions` in the GitHub UI

![Secrets page]({{ path.root }}/fig/github-secrets.png)

* Add the TestPyPi API token to GitHub Secrets (call it `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`)

![Secrets api token]({{ path.root }}/fig/github-secrets-api-token.png)

[workflow-dispatch]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch
[release-action]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#release
[release-github]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release
[pipx]: https://pypa.github.io/pipx/

Now that we have the credentials in GitHub for our PyPi package repository,
let us write out the YAML.

### Setup CD for publishing to TestPyPi

For GitHub Actions, we can use the Action [`actions/gh-action-pypi-publish`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pypi-publish).

Mainly, we need the following to replace our test publish step:
~~~
  - uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
    with:
      password: ${{ secrets.TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
      repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
~~~
{: .language-yaml }

The `secrets` is a way to gain access to and pull in secrets stored in GitHub into CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

> ## DISCLAIMER
>
> Since we will be trying to upload a package, we might get a "clash" with an existing name.
> If so, change the name of the project to something unique in the pyproject.toml.
>
{: .callout }

After uploading the following, commiting the changes, and doing a "release",
you will see something like the following:
![fig]({{ path.root }}/fig/testpypi-github-actions-success.png)

Also, you can go to your projects page and be able to see the new package show up!
  - [https://test.pypi.org/manage/projects/](https://test.pypi.org/manage/projects/)

# Wrap up

Now, we have CD setup for a Python package to a PyPi registry!

Feel free to change out the triggers, switch to PyPi, or add multiple PyPi repositories for deployment.
